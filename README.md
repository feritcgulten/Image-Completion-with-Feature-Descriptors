# Image-Completion-with-Feature-Descriptors
 Fix the corrupted regions in the provided image using data from patches.The task is a patch-based image completion algorithm using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features and the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm.

Also different methods and approaches were tried and results tried to be obtained conveniently. The goal is to replace corrupted regions in an image with patches extracted. There are optional choices after running the code to select different tasks.
